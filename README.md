# Portfolio with a blog and admin panel

Link to the working site: <a href="https://netdmitry.github.io/">netdmitry.github.io</a>

## I developed a static site, which consists of 4 pages

	1. Welcome page
	2. My work
	3. About myself
	4. Blog

## Used technologies:

	- Preprocessors: Jade, SASS
	- Workflow: gulp
	- JS, Ajax, Jquery

`Later there will refresh my content. In the meantime, see how everything is cool and beautiful`
